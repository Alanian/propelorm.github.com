title: Propel2 alpha3 is Released
published: true
---

Propel2 got more love in the last weeks which lead to a new [alpha3 release](https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2/releases/tag/2.0.0-alpha3).
[Marc](https://github.com/marcj) and a few other [great people](https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2/graphs/contributors) are doing a great job with Propel2.

A few more devs prepare even more Pull Requests to polish Propel2.
The next release target will be a first beta, lets see how things are going on.

Please give it a try and report any bug:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "propel/propel": "2.0.0-alpha3"
  }
}
```

Thank you guys!
